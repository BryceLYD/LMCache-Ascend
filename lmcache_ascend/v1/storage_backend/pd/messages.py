    dedup to the decoder's LMCache server cannot reuse those keys: the
    server identifies chunks by rolling content hashes (computed from
    token 0) + model/rank, so the token sequence itself must ride on
    the request.

    ``token_ids`` carries the FULL prompt token ids (hashing a chunk
    requires every token before it) and ``token_start`` the absolute
    token position of the first key's chunk. Both default so older
    senders keep decoding; a request without tokens simply skips the
